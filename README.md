## About Me  

I hold an **MSc in Software Engineering** from the [University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/PT), with specializations in **Knowledge Engineering** and **Cryptography and Information Security**. I also hold a **BSc in Software Engineering** from the same university.  

My professional interests include **machine learning**, **data warehousing**, **ETL systems**, and **Google Cloud**. Currently I'm working with SAP ABAP programming and SAP CPI implementations.

Most of my repositories are related to academic and research projects 🎓 — you can find some of my featured work pinned below.

## Master’s Thesis & Published Work  

As part of my MSc, I designed and implemented a **microservices-based ETL architecture** leveraging **Apache Kafka** for real-time data streaming and **Docker Compose** for service orchestration. The project focused on improving scalability, maintainability, and modularity in modern data processing systems.  

This research was published at the **20th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligent Systems (HAIS 2025)**, held in Salamanca, Spain.  

**Publication:**  
> *A Microservice System Architecture for Receiving ETL System Patterns*  
> *Hybrid Artificial Intelligent Systems, HAIS 2025, Salamanca, Spain, October 16–17, 2025, Proceedings, Part I.*
